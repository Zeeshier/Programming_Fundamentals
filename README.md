## Hello World 🌍

The "Hello World" program is the simplest program you can write in any language. It is used to demonstrate the basic syntax of a programming language.

## Operators ➕➖✖️➗

Operators are symbols that tell the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. They are the foundation of any programming language.

### Types of Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Relational Operators**: Compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).
- **Logical Operators**: Perform logical operations and return a boolean result.
- **Bitwise Operators**: Perform operations on bits and are useful for low-level programming.
- **Assignment Operators**: Assign values to variables.
- **Unary Operators**: Operate on a single operand to produce a new value.
- **Ternary Operator**: A shorthand for if-else condition.

## Conditionals 🔀

Conditionals are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. They are essential for decision-making in programming.

### Types of Conditionals

- **If Statement**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **If-Else Statement**: Executes one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if it is false.
- **Else-If Ladder**: Checks multiple conditions in sequence and executes the corresponding block of code.
- **Switch Statement**: Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

## Loops 🔄

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. They are essential for performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

### Types of Loops

- **For Loop**: Iterates a specific number of times, making it useful when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
- **While Loop**: Continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true, making it suitable for scenarios where the number of iterations is not known.
- **Do-While Loop**: Similar to the while loop, but guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once.

## Arrays 📊

Arrays are collections of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. They are used to store multiple values in a single variable, making it easier to manage and manipulate data.

### Key Concepts

- **Declaration and Initialization**: How to create and initialize arrays.
- **Accessing Elements**: How to access and modify array elements using indices.
- **Multi-dimensional Arrays**: Arrays of arrays, useful for representing matrices and other complex data structures.

## Functions 🛠️

Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, making it reusable, and improving readability.

### Key Concepts

- **Definition and Declaration**: How to define and declare functions.
- **Parameters and Return Values**: How to pass data to functions and get results back.
- **Scope and Lifetime**: The visibility and lifespan of variables within functions.

## Structures 🏗️

Structures are user-defined data types that group related variables of different types. They are used to represent a record or a complex data structure.

### Key Concepts

- **Definition and Declaration**: How to define and declare structures.
- **Accessing Members**: How to access and modify structure members.
- **Nested Structures**: Structures within structures for more complex data representation.

## Pointers 🧭

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are powerful tools for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation of data structures like arrays and linked lists.

### Key Concepts

- **Declaration and Initialization**: How to create and initialize pointers.
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: How to perform operations on pointers.
- **Pointers and Arrays**: The relationship between pointers and arrays.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: How to allocate and free memory dynamically.

## File Handling 📁

File handling involves reading from and writing to files. It is essential for data persistence and managing input/output operations.

### Key Concepts

- **Opening and Closing Files**: How to open, read, write, and close files.
- **Reading and Writing Data**: How to handle data in text and binary files.
- **Error Handling**: How to handle errors during file operations.

## String Handling 🔤

String handling involves working with sequences of characters. It includes operations like concatenation, comparison, and manipulation of strings.

### Key Concepts

- **String Declaration and Initialization**: How to create and initialize strings.
- **String Functions**: Common functions for manipulating strings, such as length, copy, concatenate, and compare.
- **Character Arrays**: How strings are represented as arrays of characters.
